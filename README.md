# LocalSearch-Greedy-SinulatedAnnealing
This project is make to try and use implement local search algorithm, including greedy hill climbing and sinnulated annealing.
Code for the sum of Gaussians is written by Dr. Joshua L. Phillips. The goal of the project is given the program that can gerate the sum of gaussians we have to use sinnulated annealing and greedy hill climbing algorithm to find maximized the sum of gaussians.
Implementation notes are in report.pdf
